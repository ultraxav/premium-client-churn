# # Comparation between different file formats to persist data
#
# The objective of this notebook is to compare different file formats to persist the data for the project, the contendants are:
#
# * Compressed CSV files
# * CSV files
# * Python Pickles Binaries
# * Apache Parquet Storage Format
#
# There are three main treats that are important for a data science projects which are:
#
# * Preserving columns data types
# * Read/Write speeds
# * Storage Space
#
# The inspiration for this notebook came from: For more details read it!.

#
# The dataset in question has **7587544 rows Ã— 156 columns**
#
# This notebook only will cover read speed and file sizes

# For this project the Apache Parquet Storage format was selected for the following reasons:
#
# * Persist data types, therefore no recasting.
# * Has load times similar to Pickle.
# * Has a file size similar to the compressed CSV.
#
# In conclusion Parquet seems to have best of all the other file formats.
#
# During or after the evolution of the project this decision could change.
